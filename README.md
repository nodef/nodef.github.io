## My Story

During my research work (2021-23), I develop a [CLI for nvGraph](https://github.com/nodef/nvgraph.sh) - a GPU-based graph analytics library by NVIDIA, using CUDA; and a [CLI for SNAP dataset](https://github.com/nodef/snap-data.sh) - a collection of more than 50 large networks. To minimize manual work, I write scripts to [Shorten author, editor, journal, and booktitle in a BibTeX file](https://github.com/javascriptf/script-minify-bibtex), another to [Get publications list from DBLP as a table in LaTeX or in BibTeX for references](https://github.com/javascriptf/script-publications-list), one to [Make a gist secret by creating a new secret gist, and deleting the old one](https://github.com/javascriptf/script-gist-conceal), and another to [Sync a file to a Git repository (such as GitHub Gist) periodically](https://github.com/javascriptf/script-git-sync-file) in Node.js. For a short-term course on Distributed Systems, I design of a simple UDP/datagram based [NTP-like client and server](https://github.com/javascriptf/nodejs-time-server) using Node.js to simulate the effect of transmission delays in a local, intra-continental, and inter-continental network. In 2015-16, I design a few Windows applications. These include a [Countdown timer](https://github.com/winp/timer) for Windows, a tool to [Calculate an 8-bit hash of a given string using XOR+ROR method](https://github.com/winp/text-hash), another to [Terminate unnecessary/unused processes](https://github.com/winp/process-kill) in Windows, and one to [Determine the IP address of a Website from its URL](https://github.com/winp/website-ip). I also write an [Intel 4004 assembler](https://github.com/javascriptf/nodejs-4004-assembler) in Node.js that converts a plain assembly language file to binary. While working at Verizon Hyderabad with Prashant Pathak, we develop a [Wireless RFID-based Snacks Ticketing System](https://github.com/raspberrypif/rfid) using a Raspberry Pi with a Weigand based HID reader.

I also write and maintain a diverse range of Open source packages for Node.js. These include tools to [Tunnel web server from private IP](https://github.com/nodef/extra-tunnel), perform automated trades with a [Javascript interface for FYERS API](https://github.com/nodef/extra-fyers), get [Insightful quotes on a topic](https://github.com/nodef/extra-quotes), and get [SPDX License text](https://github.com/nodef/extra-license). In 2018-19, I note the release of Google's new WaveNet based Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine. I use this opportunity to write a tool that [Crawls Wikipedia pages and uploads TTS to YouTube](https://github.com/nodef/wikipedia-tts). These videos are available upon searching "wikipedia audio article". To support this, I write tools to get [GCP](https://github.com/nodef/extra-gcpconfig)/[AWS](https://github.com/nodef/extra-awsconfig) config, use long text with [Google TTS](https://github.com/nodef/extra-googletts)/[Amazon Polly](https://github.com/nodef/extra-amazontts) through a [Common tool](https://github.com/nodef/extra-tts), [Interface with FFMPEG](https://github.com/nodef/extra-ffmpeg), [Generate still video from an audio and image file](https://github.com/nodef/extra-stillvideo), [Modify Ian Bishop's YouTube Uploader to handle captions](https://github.com/golangf/porjo--youtubeuploader), and [Interface with the modified YouTube uploader from Node.js](https://github.com/nodef/extra-youtubeuploader).

In 2017-18, I use full-text search in PostgreSQL to build a hand-crafted [Natural Language Query System for Indian Food Composition Tables 2017 (IFCT2017)](https://ifct2017.github.io). IFCT2017 is published by T. Longvah, R. Ananthan, K. Bhaskarachary, and K. Venkaiah from National Institute of Nutrition (NIN). It contains detailed nutrient composition of 528 key foods in India. I use a PDF to Excel converter to read data in tables of each page, merge them together, fix conversion issues through manual checking, and convert it to CSV. Further, I adjust the units used for each nutrient to grams, and add additional relevant high-level columns. Finally I write a Node.js package to get [Programmatic access to this Compositions data](https://github.com/ifct2017/compositions). Data from a number of additional tables, including the compositions data, is available in the [Main package](https://github.com/ifct2017/ifct2017). To support natural language queries, I convert the [English language query to an informal SQL](https://github.com/nodef/pg-english) first, perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) with [Promised Map interface for Table in PostgreSQL](https://github.com/nodef/map-pg), and then convert [Informal SQL SELECT to formal SQL](https://github.com/nodef/pg-slang). Testing required constant resetting and provisioning of new databases. For this, I write a script to [Manage Addon Pool of an App in Heroku](https://github.com/nodef/heroku-addonpool). I also prepare CLI tools to convert [E numbers](https://github.com/nodef/food-e) and [INS numbers](https://github.com/nodef/food-ins) of food additives to their respective full names.

I also maintain collections of functions for in-built types in Node.js, such as, [Arrays](https://github.com/nodef/extra-array), [Sets](https://github.com/nodef/extra-set), [Maps](https://github.com/nodef/extra-map), [Objects](https://github.com/nodef/extra-object), [Iterables](https://github.com/nodef/extra-iterable), [Entries](https://github.com/nodef/extra-entries), [Lists](https://github.com/nodef/extra-lists), [IEntries](https://github.com/nodef/extra-ientries), [ILists](https://github.com/nodef/extra-ilists), [Sorted Arrays](https://github.com/nodef/extra-sorted-array), [Array Views](https://github.com/nodef/extra-array-view), [Booleans](https://github.com/nodef/extra-boolean), [Bits](https://github.com/nodef/extra-bit), [Integers](https://github.com/nodef/extra-integer), [Numbers](https://github.com/nodef/extra-number), [Strings](https://github.com/nodef/extra-string), [BigInts](https://github.com/nodef/extra-bigint), [Functions](https://github.com/nodef/extra-function), and [Async Functions](https://github.com/nodef/extra-async-function). In addition, I extend in-built modules, such as, [File System (FS)](https://github.com/nodef/extra-fs), [Child Process](https://github.com/nodef/extra-child-process), [Path](https://github.com/nodef/extra-path), and [Math](https://github.com/nodef/extra-math). To support the automated building, testing, and documentation generation, I write and use a special [Build tool](https://github.com/nodef/extra-build) - this requires utilities for processing [JavaScript](https://github.com/nodef/extra-javascript-text), [JSDoc](https://github.com/nodef/extra-jsdoc-text), and [Markdown](https://github.com/nodef/extra-markdown-text) text. Building documentation for some packages requires the use of a [Custom TypeDoc theme](https://github.com/nodef/extra-typedoc-theme). To generate ASCII videos of examples automatically, an [Asciinema-based tool](https://github.com/nodef/extra-asciinema) can be used. To delete old/unused packages automatically, I write a tool to [Delete NPM packages in an organization](https://github.com/javascriptf/devtools-delete-npm-org-packages) using Puppeteer. I originally conceived of maintaining Open source code as a potential business venture - which allows me to make passive money through donations. However, the market was already bustling with utility packages. Despite meticulous documentation and detailed list of functions, differentiation proved elusive.
